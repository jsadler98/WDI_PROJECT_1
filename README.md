# WDI30 Project 1: The Unicorn Simulator

## Introduction

I constructed this app during the 3rd week of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembley London, to create this app I used Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. This game is a grab and collect game so as the character collides with the collectables the score will increase until the timer runs out.
