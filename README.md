# WDI30 Project 1: The Unicorn Simulator

## Introduction

I constructed this app during the 3rd week of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembley London, to create this app I used Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. This game is a grab and collect game so as the character collides with the collectables the score will increase until the timer runs out.

## The Idea

The idea with this game was to create something very simple but addictive. When the arrows are pressed the unicorn character will move from side to side in the playing zone collecting the falling coins, the coins will stop falling after 30 seconds and the score will be saved on the screen until the reset button is hit.
